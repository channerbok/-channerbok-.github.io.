             Hello everyone! My name is Channer Bok and welcome to my website. I am Software Engineer working in the Portland area and am currently a Post-Bac student at Portland State University as well as an Intern at Intel on the Platform Debug Team. I hope you enjoy what you see here as I am happy to share all th projects and work I have been able to do as I journey through programming.

            <h2 class =format_title> Disaster Relief</h2>
            <p class =format_body>
              Enables user to catalog and organize various relief efforts in response to a natural disaster. It was created during th 2020 Oregon wildfires and was inspired to be able to 
              assist the citizens impacted by the fires. It allows the user to add different types of assistance to the program as well as have a separate functionality allowing a user 
              to look up what relief efforts have already been added to the program. The code utilizes Object Oreinted Programming as well as a Base class as well as Derived classes in order to streamline the coding process. 
              The data Structures used were multiple circular linked lists that provided the functionality to Add, Remove, Display All, Display Type and Retrieve objects throughout the program.

            <h1 class =format_title> Communications App</h1>
            <p class =format_body>
              Provides the user with multiple communication programs that mirror real world applications such as Email, Discord and Facebook Messenger. 
              Allows user to choose which program they would like to use and then choose appropriate message detals such as subject, recipient, message, etc.
              The program itself utilizes Object Oreinted Programming as well an Abstract Base Class and three Derived classes to achieve its goals as well as RTTI to dynamically cast functions for the 
              Discord application. The data Structures within the program are Linear Linked Lists and arrays. The program catalogs all messages and allows the user
              to search, add, or delete them throughout the life of the program.

            <h1 class =format_title>Monster Battle</h1>
            <p class =format_body>
              Simulates a Pokemon style monster battle game that allows the user to choose their own monster from a selection of monsters and simulate a battle between other monsters.
              The program uses Operator Overloading to enable the objects to be able to interact with each other using operators as a function of finding out the results of the 
              simulated battles. All of the following operators (=,  +,  +=, ==,  !=) were overloaded for the classes in order to alter and set the values for their attributes and other information.
              The program was implemented using two data structures, a Binary Search Tree, and an Array of Doubly Linked List both created by their own node classes and managed by a singular list class
              that provided the functionality to Add, Remove, Display All, Display Type and Retrieve objects throughout the program.
